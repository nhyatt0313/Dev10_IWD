				<!-- Restaurant Description -->
				Dronies Pizza is here to change the game in pizza delivery. With our fleet of high speed quad-copters we'll have a hot pizza in your hands before your drool 
				has a chance to hit the floor. Our completely automated kitchen never misses a beat, allowing us to have the most accurate and reliable delivery times. If 
				you're still skeptical about drones flying over your house come on down and meet our nearly sentient oven. Our location offers a cold and metalic feeling
				that pairs nicely with the complete absence of life. Whether you want to enjoy your pizza in cold isolation, at home, or on your morning run, you are no 
				longer bound by conventional pizza delivery options.
