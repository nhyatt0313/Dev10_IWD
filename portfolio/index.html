						<p>Working at the Space Science and Engineering Laboratory at Montana State University gave me the opportunity broaden my skillset. Even though  
						I was studying physics, I learned a lot about programming and was able to contribute to a cross functional team of students designing and 
						manufacturing small satellites called CubeSats. My main role during the time I was on the software team involved <span style="background-color: lightblue;">debugging and troubleshooting 
						embedded systems.</span> </P>
